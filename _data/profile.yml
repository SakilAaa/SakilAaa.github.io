  <p>
    Hi there! I'm a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University<a/>.  
    Previously, I spent a summer at <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu">CMU HCII</a> as a research intern under the supervision of <a href="https://haiyizhu.com">Haiyi Zhu</a>, 
    and prior to that, I was an exchange student at <a href="https://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://violetpeng.github.io">Nanyun (Violet) Peng</a>.
    I've also been fortunate to conduct research with <a href="https://www.yianyin.net">Yian Yin</a> at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu">Cornell</a>.
  </p>
  <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of HCI, NLP, and Computational Social Science.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>At the interaction level, I explore how language models can assist humans in creative <br>and self-reflective tasks, emphasizing augmentation rather than automation of thought.</li>
    <li>At the societal level, I use large-scale computational analyses to quantify social phenomena <br>and uncover how AI technologies reshape information diffusion in online environments.</li>
  </ul>
