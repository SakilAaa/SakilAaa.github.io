    <p style="font-size: 1em;"> 🫂  Psychotherapy depends on subtle nonverbal cues vital for effective care. <br>
     💬  Our study advances beyond text-based simulations of psychotherapy patients by integrating these cues—pauses, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hesitations, and prosody—to help trainees detect client withdrawal earlier and address accordingly.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1em;">🤥  LLMs leave fake references in research papers — traces we can all spot, but few can measure. <br>
    📚  We extract and cross-check millions of references across major databases, uncovering a steep, almost exponential <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rise in unmatched citations—and, after de-noising, a large corpus of genuine hallucinations.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1em;">🤔  Do reasoning models' higher math scores come at the cost—or benefit—of greater psychological depth? <br>
    ✏️  We perform math post-training to disentangle its effect on text generation and run human evaluations comparing<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; base models and their reasoning variants across empathy, narrative complexity, and other dimensions.
